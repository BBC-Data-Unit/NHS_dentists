In January 2022 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59874320) around 1,000 NHS dentists left the health service last year - the equivelent of more than 2,500 posts across England and Wales.

Unions warned NHS dentistry is "hanging by a thread" with some patients facing two-year waits for routine check ups.

The British Dental Association (BDA) said unhappiness with the NHS dental contract was a key factor.

The number of NHS dentists working in two English clinical commissioning group areas (CCGs) fell by more than a quarter in the year ending March 31, 2021, with the combined equivalent of 2,435 dentists leaving the health service.

The worst-affected was NHS Portsmouth CCG, which lost 26% of its NHS dentists over 12 months.

Meanwhile, 28 other English CCGs have lost at least 10% of their NHS dentists. 

In Wales, 6% of NHS dental posts were lost, with 83 fewer dentists working across health boards than the year before.

The worst-affected area was the Swansea Bay University Health Board, which had 22% fewer NHS dentists compared to the year before.

NHS England said patients who needed care the most should be prioritised, and said it had set up 600 urgent dental centres across England.

Days after our stoiry was published, Westminster allocated £50million in dentistry funding. The British Dental Association credited our story for the government's response.
